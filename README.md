Figure  is the model of the robot РФ-202М.

An industrial robot is a robot system used for manufacturing. Industrial robots are automated, programmable and capable of movement on three or more axes.
I was tasked with Software development for simulation of industrial robot РФ-202М (3D-graphics, .NET (OpenGL)) as a part of manufacturing system (optionally). The figure below is the source image used to construct this robot in Open
